Steps to run the app:

1. Build the app with command ./mvnw clean compile package
2. Run the jar using command java -jar target/vaccinebookingvocal.jar
3. Open localhost:8080/ and submit your pincode. By default it searches for 201301 pincode.

That's it. Wait for the music to play and book the slot instantly.
